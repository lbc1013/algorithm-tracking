# Algorithm-tracking

This is an app called 'algorithm-tracker' tracking the algorithm that the user has done.</br>
I created this app to practice CRUD operation using the MERN STACK Development.

This app allows user to Create, Read, Update and Delete as an algorithm list.

  *MongoDB - document database</br>
  *Express(.js) - Node.js web framework</br>
  *React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework</br>
  *Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server
